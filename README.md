# BiDAF (Bidirectional Attention Flow)

This repository contains the implementation of the **Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF)** model for machine reading comprehension and question-answering tasks. The BiDAF model is designed to process context and query to provide precise answers from a given passage.

## Repository Structure

- **`Bidaf.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and training workflow for the BiDAF model.
- **`Bidaf.py`**: Python script version of the BiDAF implementation for users who prefer non-notebook environments.
- **`Data.zip`**: Compressed dataset file containing the training and validation data for BiDAF. Unzip this file before running the code.
- **`bidafglove_tv.npy`**: Pre-trained GloVe embeddings used for training the BiDAF model.
- **`bidaftrain.pkl`**: Serialized training dataset in Python pickle format.
- **`bidafvalid.pkl`**: Serialized validation dataset in Python pickle format.

## Features

- Implementation of BiDAF model for question-answering tasks.
- Utilizes pre-trained GloVe embeddings for word representation.
- Support for training and validation workflows.
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and Python script for streamlined execution.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `torch`
  - `tqdm`
  - `pickle`

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
- Unzip the `Data.zip` file to extract the training and validation datasets.
- Ensure the `.pkl` and `.npy` files are in the same directory as the scripts or notebooks.

### Running the Code
1. For interactive experimentation, open `Bidaf.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Bidaf.ipynb
   ```
2. For command-line execution, use the `Bidaf.py` script:
   ```bash
   python Bidaf.py
   ```

## Results and Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like Exact Match (EM) and F1 score. These scores are calculated on the validation dataset.
